<h3>Giving Speeches to Future Graduates</h3>
<p> Mya Cocchiola stood confidently at the podium in her old high school gymnasium in Wantagh, NY, a place she had called home for years. The room was filled with eager faces, students who were on the brink of making one of the most significant decisions of their young lives: choosing their future college and major. Mya, a bright and compassionate college senior, knew the weight of this decision all too well. With a smile on her face, she began her speech, sharing her personal journey and the lessons she had learned along the way. </p>

<p>"As you embark on this exciting journey of selecting your future paths, let's remember that it's not just about the prestige of a college or the perceived 'right' major," Mya began, her voice filled with warmth. "It's also about personal well-being and mental health. College can be an incredible experience, but it can also be challenging. It's essential to choose a place where you feel supported, where you can thrive both academically and emotionally. Remember, your happiness and mental health are just as important as your career aspirations. Take care of yourself, reach out for help when needed, and prioritize your well-being. In the end, a successful college experience is one where you not only excel academically but also grow as a person, and that starts with self-care and self-compassion."</p>

<p>Mya's words resonated deeply with the students, as she shared not only wisdom but also vulnerability, reflecting on her own struggles and how she had found her path to personal well-being. Her speech served as a reminder to all in the room that the journey to college and beyond was not just about reaching the destination but also about taking care of oneself along the way. </p>
